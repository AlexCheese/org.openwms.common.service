= Interaction Map

This chapter describes the actions, respectively the flow of actions, an API consumer can perform to achieve the use cases. The COMMON
Service API deals essentially with `Locations`, `LocationGroups` and `TransportUnits` therefore those entities are centric elements in the
interaction model and can be referenced from the main index page.

Like human readable websites provide a sitemap, a machine readable API can be visualized with an interaction map. A fully automated RESTful
maturity-level-3 API offers index resources beside typical business resources. The API entry point is the top-level index resource that is
used to navigate to all possible entities with their operations.

This top-level, or root, index page offers further links to primary resources, like `Locations`, `LocationGroups` and `TransportUnits`.
