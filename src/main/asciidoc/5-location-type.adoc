== LocationType
A `LocationType` represents the type of a `Location`. Each `Location` must belong to one and only one specific `LocationType`. This type
definition basically defined physical dimensions of the kind of `Location`. Usually `LocationTypes` are creared statically when a project
is set up. Types may be changed, but not deleted at runtime, because every `Location` is assigned to one `LocationType`.

=== Find all existing LocationTypes
If a client wants to get a list of all existing `LocationTypes`, a simple `GET` request to the plural resource is required. Notice that no
paging nor sorting is implemented in the API, because the expected retrieved data is less than hundred entries,

The server responds with the existing `LocationTypes` or an empty list:
